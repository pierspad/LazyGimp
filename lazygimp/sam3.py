# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# SAM 3.1 — gated on Hugging Face. The generic huggingface_hub error text
# ("...we cannot find the requested files in the local cache...") is what
# you get for a plain 401/403 too, so string-sniffing the exception message
# alone cannot reliably tell "not approved yet" apart from "bad token" apart
# from "actually offline". Instead, probe explicitly and in order: does the
# token authenticate at all (whoami), does IT have access to the gated repo
# (model_info) — only THEN attempt the real (multi-GB) download. This is
# what actually fixes "non so perché non scarica il modello sam3.1": the
# failure now names the exact cause instead of a generic cache-miss message.
